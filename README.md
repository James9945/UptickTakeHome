Task
The Task is to create an Api that has some Crud fuctionality in it, the challenge is this particular task doesnt have view I'll have to find a way to handle how I'll know if the api is working.

Description
To solve this problem, I use the knowledge i have on node.js and Javascript.

Installation
To perform this task I have to do some installations:
node.js installation
Visual Studio installation etc.

Dependencies Used
bcrypt: "^6.0.0",: for encrytion of password and decryption.
dotenv: "^16.5.0",: handles the dotenv varibles.
express: "^5.1.0",: the node js framework for the server.
jsonwebtoken: "^9.0.2",: this is use for token when authenticating and authorization.
mongoose: "^8.15.1",: this is used for the database interaction, as I used the mongodb database.
nodemon: "^3.1.10".: this is for auto refreshing the server after a change is made.

Usage
If you open the link it'll display the data already in the database, to add books you'll use the postman to do that as the endpoints request are all there.
All the commands are in the postman documentation.
